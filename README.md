# janet-lucide

This library contains Lucide icons in form of Janet standard data structures. These are meant to be used together with something like [spork/htmlgen](https://janet-lang.org/api/spork/htmlgen.html).

## LICENSE

The `lucide` folder is a submodule with the official [lucide](https://github.com/lucide-icons/lucide) Git repository. See their license for that part. It was using ISC the last time I checked.

The rest is MIT - see the `LICENSE` file at the root of the repository for details.
